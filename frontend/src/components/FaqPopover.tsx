      question: "What is sSUI?",

        "Spring Staked SUI (sSUI) is the first LST built using the SpringSui Standard.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are Ecosystem LSTs?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Other LSTs created via the SpringSui Standard are operated by
          independent third-party teams rather than Suilend and are referred to
          as Ecosystem LSTs. Launching these Ecosystem LSTs via SpringSui will
          soon become a permissionless process.
          <br />
          <br />
          For example, Mirai Staked SUI (mSUI) is an Ecosystem LST.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What is the SpringSui Standard?",
      answer:
        "SpringSui is an open source LST standard that offers infinite liquidity through instant unstaking, thereby reducing depegging risks. It also enables the creation of custom LSTs.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does it work?",
      answer: (
        <>
          When you stake SUI, you get a token that represents your stake. These
          tokens can lose value (depeg) during market volatility or low
          liquidity, creating risks like liquidations.
          <br />
          <br />
          SIP-33 fixes this by allowing instant redemption of LSTs for Sui,
          ensuring no depegging. sSUI maintains strong liquidity, making it more
          secure than other LSTs.
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "Why sSUI?",
      answer:
        "The SpringSui Standard offers liquidity through sSUI tokens, allowing users to freely transfer or sell them while still earning staking rewards. Users can also use sSUI in DeFi protocols, maximizing the utility of their staked assets.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does unstaking take?",
      answer:
        "sSUI can be unstaked instantly for SUI and only requires 1 transaction.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I collect my yield?",
      answer:
        "sSUI's yield is built into its price. At launch, 1 sSUI equals 1 SUI. As rewards grow, sSUI's value increases (e.g., 1 sSUI = 1.05 SUI), ensuring all holders benefit from the yield, regardless of where the token is stored.",
    },
    {
      question: "How are APRs determined?",
      answer:
        "The APR for sSUI comes mainly from Sui network staking rewards, influenced by factors like total staked SUI, inflation, and validator performance. High-performing validators earn more, while poor ones face penalties. Commission fees from validators and protocol fees from SpringSui Standard LSTs also impact the final APR for sSUI holders.",
    },
    {
      question: "What fees are there?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Mint Fee: A fee charged when minting a SpringSui LST by depositing
          SUI. For example, minting 1,000 SUI of a SpringSui LST with a 10 bps
          mint fee (staking fee) would result in a 1 SUI fee.
          <br />
          <br />
          Redemption Fee: A fee charged when converting a SpringSui LST back to
          SUI. For example, redeeming 1,000 units of a SpringSui LST with a 1 bp
          redemption fee would result in a 0.1 SUI fee.
          <br />
          <br />
          Performance Fee: The performance fee is the percentage of staking
          rewards kept as a fee by the LST pool operator or owner. This is
          deducted on every epoch change (~1 day).
        </>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks?",
      answer: (
        <>
          Smart Contract Risk: LSTs like sSUI are vulnerable to smart contract
          exploits, potentially leading to loss of funds if hacked. A failure in
          the unstake mechanism could prevent users from redeeming their tokens,
          causing depegging and a loss in value. The SpringSui Standard
          mitigates this with rigorous audits.
          <br />
          <br />
          Validator Risk: Rewards depend on validator performance. Poor
          performance or slashing (penalties for misbehavior) can reduce rewards
          or lead to loss of staked assets.
